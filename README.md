# Python-Tip-Calculator-


# Project Description -   
Right now i'm writing a small tip calculator in ptyhon. As of now the logic take to types of input the first being the bill amount and the second being the tip percentage. When you enter the tip percentage as user input you are able to enter it in two types of format the first being a whole number such as: 10,15,20 and the second format being 10%,15%,20%. If you enter your tip percentage using the second format then i have an if condition which says if the last character of tip percent is equal to % then lets pop it and then use the whole number to calculate a tip for you. In order to see if the the last character is indeed a % symol, we will index the string but read it in reverse so this way the last character is read first and if it is equal to a % symbol then lets do some code.  In order to pop or remove the last character we used some slicing and remove it by saying y = y[:-1]. as we continue with the logic, and now that we have our percent symbol removed we want to go ahead and add a period the front of our integer string. The easiest way i figured out was by saying y = "." + y since both y and the period are strings python reads that expressions as a concatination and joins the period and y together, and adds the period to the front. we also use type conversion and covert our new decimal number into a floating point number so now it reads like a real decimal number and format it so it rounds and prints out to 2 decimal places.
