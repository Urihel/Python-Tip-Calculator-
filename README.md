# Python-Tip-Calculator-


# Project Description -   
Right now i'm writing a small tip calculator in ptyhon. As of now the logic take to types of input the first being the bill amount and the second being the tip percentage. When you enter the tip percentage as user input you are able to enter it in two types of format the first being a whole number such as: 10,15,20 and the second format being 10%,15%,20%. If you enter your tip percentage using the second format then i have an if condition which says if thelast character of tip percent is equal to % then lets pop it and then use the whole number to calculate a tip for you. In order to pop or remove the last character we used some slicing and remove it by saying y = y[:-1]. As of now im still working on building the logic. What i will be adding to this how i use type conversion to convert my string user input over to int value input and use it along with bill_amount to calculate a tip percent.
